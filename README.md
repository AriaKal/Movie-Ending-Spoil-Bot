# Movie-Ending-Spoil-Bot
A python script that generates the title + last couple of lines from random movie scripts and sends as text. 

The dataset of scripts is obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/parthplc/movie-scripts?select=Scripts
The original set contains complete scripts of 2827 movies. For the purposes of this project, each script is cut to only the remaining 10-20 lines at the end.
