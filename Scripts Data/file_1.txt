ALADDIN: 

Jasmine: A whole new life 
Both: (with off-camera chorus) For you and me! 
Men's chorus: A whole new world! (They fly off into the moonlight, and after they have disappeared, the moon turns and reveals the GENIE's laughing face. Suddenly the film is grabbed "off the projector", the GENIE lifts it up and looks at the audience.) 
Genie: Made ya look! (Drops the film back to normal, with the normal moon.)
The End
