REVISIONS:
 
Comin' down the chute! The papers slide down the chute; Jack moves to the front of the line grinning -- seeing Sarah smiling at him from the gates. Jack sings out, the song soars, continuing as the Newsies are back on the job -- getting their papers, fanning out across the courtyard, into the city beyond. It is indeed a fine life as closing credits roll until we -- FADE OUT. 
THE END
