South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut

TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays, Kenny's little body floats up and up through the clouds. (NOTE: This will also be done in 3-D CGI) Rays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into the warmth of the baby blueness. Angels encircle him and give him a pair of wings. They smile gently. He feels calm. He feels good. Amidst a group of angels, Kenny flies upwards and finally... into Heaven. 
THE END.
