HONEYDRIPPER

Two strings on a `guitar' made of a plank of wood and baling wire. He carefully takes a length of clothesline rope leading from the guitar, tacks the end of it to the wall of the shack, plugging himself in. He looks to Lonnie, who nods, and then- -he begins to PLAY in time with Lonnie. We CRANE UP and away from them, the MUSIC spilling out over the field- It sounds a whole lot like rock and roll.
