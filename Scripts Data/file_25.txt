PURPLE RAIN 

Catch her look, laugh heartily and join in again. The MUSIC segues into a fierce BEAT. The CROWD lets out a ROAR! Prince strips off his guitar, streaks center- stage. The Band launches into "Baby, I'm A Star." ...And the CROWD laughing, dancing, shouting and loving. The CLUB is ALIVE! And the MUSIC continues...forever... 
THE END
