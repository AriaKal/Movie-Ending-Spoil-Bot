TAKING SIDES 

Furtwangler conducting. Goebbels and other high-ranking Nazis in the audience. When the music finishes, Furtwangler turns and bows. Goebbels rises and shakes hands with him. Furtwangler takes his handkerchief and wipes his hands. The film replays this gesture several times - Furtwangler wiping his hands.
