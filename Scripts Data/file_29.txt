WARM SPRINGS 

President of the United States. He was elected three more times -- unprecedented in U.S. History. During his years as President, he saw the country through the Great Depression and a world war waged on six continents. On April 12, 1945, in the thirteenth year of his presidency, at the age of sixty-three, Franklin Roosevelt died in his cottage at Warm Springs. The beneficiary of his $562,000 life insurance policy was Warm Springs... which continues to flourish as a rehabilitation center to this day.
