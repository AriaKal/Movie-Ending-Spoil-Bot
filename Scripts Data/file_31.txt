DANCES WITH WOLVES

Dances With Wolves is at the canyon's rim. He listens a long time, fully entranced by the wolf's howl. He is still listening when it is gone. A whisper floats out of the night behind him. WIND IN HIS HAIR (O.S.) Dances With Wolves... Dances With Wolves shrinks back from the canyon's rim, turns and trots off into the darkness, following his friends.
