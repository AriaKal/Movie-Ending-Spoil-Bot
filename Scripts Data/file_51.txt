 LABOR OF LOVE his vision BLURS... WHITE FLUTTERING... SLOW-MOTION. THE IMAGE CLEARS... Maurice smiles as he makes out the image of a WHITE DOVE FLYING ABOVE HIM... Maurice takes a short breath, very short. His body goes still -- his eyes stay fixes at one point... No more pain, no more loss, no more words... The water washes over Maurice A. Parker... Over his lifeless body... And over his smile... FADE TO BLACK.
