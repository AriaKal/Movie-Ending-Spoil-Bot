 AMOUR There, everything is as usual. Eva continues into the living room. There too, everything is as usual. Eva stops by the piano stool. Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. Then she heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. On the table lie the remains of a snack. Eva looks at the table, turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear STREET NOISE. Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the armchairs. Her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room. END CREDITS (white on a black background)
